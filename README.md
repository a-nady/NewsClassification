In recent years, a great majority of people have moved to web portals like Google for news consumption. The quality of portalsâ€™ news classification plays a significant role in providing adequate information to the consumers. For this project, I explored the possibility of utilizing keyword extraction to improve a news classification task. First, I created a model using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. Then, I added a keyword extraction layer before the classification model and ran classification only based on keywords. However, discovering it did not improve the performance, I experimented with weighting TF-IDF values depending on whether or not a token was a keyword, which resulted in slight better performance; the number of correct answers increased, but only around 1 percent.
